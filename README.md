This code addresses the Dining Philosophers Problem through two methods:

Without Deadlock Avoidance: Demonstrates philosopher behavior based on fork availability. It identifies which philosophers can or cannot eat based on neighboring fork status.
With Deadlock Avoidance: Implements a solution using semaphores to avoid deadlocks. Philosophers utilize semaphores strategically to acquire necessary resources without encountering deadlocks.
To run the code:

Choose option 1 to simulate the problem without deadlock avoidance.
Select option 2 to demonstrate the deadlock avoidance solution.
Option 3 exits the program. Input the number of philosophers and their preferences to observe different scenarios.
